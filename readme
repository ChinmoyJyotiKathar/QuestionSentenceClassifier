Hi there!

It's Chinmoy here! Glad to see you have found your way into my repository. :D

I created this classifier as a personal mini project as I couldn't find any solid Question Sentece Classifier online.
This is still quite raw and is giving 87~90 ish accuracy rate (tested on NLTK chat corpus).

I have also added voiced input, the reason for which has a long story.
To remove voiced input, just remove lines 124-127 and uncomment 128.

If you find any difficulty in loading the pickled classifier just ping me at:

Also if you need the raw classifer all you have to do is ping me.
